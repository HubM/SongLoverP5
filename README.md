# SongLoverP5
Render of the project created during the RebootCamp (ECV Digital Bordeaux). We had to use a Raspberrypi 3 as a web server and put content on it. I have just made a simple equalizer using P5.js with sound library.
This repo is only the content of the webserver. I continue to work on this project for fun :)

## How to use it 

+ Clone the project and go to the folder  
`git clone https://github.com/HubM/SongLoverP5.git`
`cd SongLoverP5`


+ Run the project  
 `npm install && npm start`  



+ Enjoy !
